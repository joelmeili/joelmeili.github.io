# About me
I'm a Biostatistics master's graduate from the University of Zurich, Switzerland. Prior to my master's degree I worked as a research assistant at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich at the Center for Law and Economics, where I helped design and evaluate economic experiments in a lab and classroom setting. For my master's thesis I worked on a project where we investigated methods that detect differentially regulated genes e.g. eisaR, BRIE2 and compared the performance with a novel Bayesian approach DifferentialRegulation on a semi-simulated data set based on mouse kidney single-cell RNA-seq data.
